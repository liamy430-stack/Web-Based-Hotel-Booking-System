Concept Plan: Hotel Reservation System
üß© Overview

We are building a Hotel Reservation System using Django (backend) and HTML/CSS (frontend).
The system will manage:

Registered guests (members)

Guest reservations and walk-in bookings

Rooms and room types (single, double, suite)

Room availability & rate rules (seasonal rates / per-night)

Payments and booking confirmations

Admin dashboard for hotel staff

Goal: Provide a web-based platform for customers to search and book rooms, and for staff to manage rooms, bookings, and revenue.

üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Concept

/rooms/ ‚Äî Room list (search results)

/rooms/<slug>/ ‚Äî Room detail & gallery

/book/<room_slug>/ ‚Äî Booking form

/account/bookings/ ‚Äî User bookings

/admin/ ‚Äî Django admin (staff)

Design: Clean hotel-themed layout, card grids for rooms, date pickers for check-in/out.

üß≠ Development Phases (suggested timeline)

Phase 1 ‚Äî Setup & Planning (1‚Äì2 days)

Start project, create apps: users, rooms, bookings

Setup settings.py, static & media, templates dir, git

Phase 2 ‚Äî Models & Migrations (2‚Äì3 days)

Implement CustomUser, RoomType, Room, Booking, Payment, Amenity

makemigrations & migrate

Phase 3 ‚Äî Admin & Basic Views (2 days)

Register models in admin, create basic list/detail views and templates

Phase 4 ‚Äî Booking Flow & Availability (3‚Äì4 days)

Implement availability logic & booking form, price calc, booking confirmation

Phase 5 ‚Äî Auth & User Dashboard (2 days)

Login/register, user bookings page, profile edits

Phase 6 ‚Äî Payments & Email (2‚Äì3 days)

Phase 7 ‚Äî Reports & Polish (2 days)

Occupancy/revenue reports, UI improvements, responsive CSS

Phase 8 ‚Äî Testing & Deployment (2‚Äì3 days)

Unit tests for availability & booking logic, deploy (Heroku/Render/VPS)

üîß Availability Logic (important)

To check room availability:

def is_available(room, check_in, check_out):
    qs = Booking.objects.filter(
        room=room,
        status__in=['PENDING','CONFIRMED'],
        check_in__lt=check_out,
        check_out__gt=check_in
    )
    return not qs.exists()


This prevents any overlapping bookings.
